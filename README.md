# Smart Trafic light Sysytem 

In India's major cities, the average travel time has risen significantly during peak hours. The standard traffic signal operates on a continuous set of commands that are stored in its memory. It does not consider the current traffic conditions. By building AI-based smart traffic lights, information such as   the number of vehicles in each lane can be used to switch on/off the signal. This system will assist in clearing congested traffic and shortening commute time. This technological advancement will also benefit emergency vehicles such as ambulances by giving high priority to their lane. This project's main objective is to develop an AI system that will operate the traffic light at the intersection of four roads, each of which has three lanes. The results showed that AI-based traffic signal systems outperformed traditional traffic signal systems. The average vehicle waiting time has been reduced by 42%.
